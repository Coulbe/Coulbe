## 💫 About Me

Hello, I’m **Coulbe**! I’m deeply enthusiastic about **data science**, **data engineering**, and uncovering new insights through **knowledge discovery**. My current focus is on contributing to **Notfall Engineers**, an innovative platform dedicated to transforming emergency building maintenance using advanced technologies like **AI**, **Cloud Computing**, and **Blockchain**.

### 🌍 My Work at Notfall Engineers

At **Notfall Engineers**, I work on projects that push the boundaries of technology to make building maintenance faster, safer, and more efficient. Here’s how my expertise aligns with our mission:

🔹 **Data-Driven Decision Making**: I help power **predictive maintenance** and **AI-based task-matching** systems. These intelligent solutions leverage data science to anticipate and resolve maintenance issues before they become critical, ensuring reliability and prompt service.

🔹 **Scalable Data Engineering**: Through **cloud-based architectures**, I’m building scalable data workflows that provide secure and fast data access for real-time maintenance tracking and management. This allows our platform to support growing user demands while maintaining high standards for performance and security.

🔹 **Blockchain for Data Transparency**: With **Blockchain technology**, we’re ensuring that all maintenance records are securely managed and tamper-proof, enhancing transparency and trust for property managers, engineers, and users alike.
