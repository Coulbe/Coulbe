## üí∞ Notcoins Reward Structure and Equity Share

Contributions are rewarded with **Notcoins**, representing shares in Notfall Engineers. 

- **Total Supply**: 20,000,000 Notcoins (fixed supply).
- **Earning Notcoins**: Based on task complexity and impact.
- **Ownership Percentage**:
  \[
  P = {N_{{earned}}} divided by {N_{{total mined}}} times 100
  \]
  Where:
  - \( N_{{earned}} \) = Your total Notcoins earned.
  - \( N_{{total mined}} ) = Total Notcoins mined by all contributors.

For example, if 2,000,000 Notcoins have been mined and you've earned 40,000 Notcoins:
\[
P = {40,000} divided by {2,000,000} times 100 = 2%
\]

You can track your Notcoin balance and ownership percentage on the **Contributor Dashboard**, updated monthly.

## üìà Advanced Valuation Scenarios

Our platform‚Äôs valuation grows as we achieve milestones, increase users, and generate revenue. Here‚Äôs how Notcoin value might change in various growth stages:

### Scenario 1: Early Growth Phase
- **Initial Valuation**: $500,000
- **Price per Notcoin**:
  \[
  {Price per Notcoin} = {500,000} divided by {20,000,000} = 0.025 { USD}
  \]
  With 10,000 Notcoins, your equity value would be:
  \[
  10,000 times 0.025 = 250 { USD}
  \]

### Scenario 2: Post-Milestone Growth
- **Valuation**: $2,500,000 after key milestones (e.g., predictive maintenance release).
- **Price per Notcoin**:
  \[
  {Price per Notcoin} = {2,500,000} divided by {20,000,000} = 0.125 { USD}
  \]
  With 10,000 Notcoins:
  \[
  10,000 times 0.125 = 1,250 \text{ USD}
  \]

### Scenario 3: High Growth Phase
- **Valuation**: $10,000,000 after a major release.
- **Price per Notcoin**:
  \[
  {Price per Notcoin} = {10,000,000} divided by {20,000,000} = 0.50 { USD}
  \]
  With 10,000 Notcoins:
  \[
  10,000 times 0.50 = 5,000 { USD}
  \]

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Validator Roles and Reward Structure

Validators are critical to maintaining the quality of contributions and rewarding high-impact contributions.

### Validator Reward Calculation
\[
V_{{reward}} = 10 + (5 times I)
\]
where **I** = Impact factor (1 to 3)

Example: A high-impact task (impact factor 3) would yield:
\[
V_{{reward}} = 10 + (5 times 3) = 25 { Notcoins}
\]

Validators are crucial to Notfall‚Äôs growth and are rewarded with additional equity and recognition.
