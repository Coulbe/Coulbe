## **How to Contribute**

### **1. Workflow for Submitting Code**

Contributors submit code using a structured **Pull Request (PR)** workflow in GitHub:

#### **Step 1: Fork and Clone**
- Fork the repository into your GitHub account.
- Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/notfall-contributors.git
  cd notfall-contributors
  ```

#### **Step 2: Create a Feature Branch**
Work in an isolated branch for each task:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-login-api
```

#### **Step 3: Implement Changes**
Make changes as per the task requirements and guidelines:
- Write clean, well-documented code.
- Include unit tests for new features.

#### **Step 4: Commit and Push**
- Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Add login API to authController"
  ```
- Push to your fork:
  ```bash
  git push origin feature/add-login-api
  ```

#### **Step 5: Submit a Pull Request**
- Navigate to your forked repository.
- Click **New Pull Request** and select the base repository (`Coulbe/notfall-contributors`).
- Fill in the PR template and link to related issues.

---

### **2. Reviewer Workflow**

- Reviewers evaluate PRs for:
  - Code quality and adherence to guidelines.
  - Functional correctness.
  - Passing tests in CI/CD pipelines.
- Request changes or approve the PR for merging.

---

### **3. Merging and Updating**

- Once approved, a maintainer merges the PR.
- Contributors should delete the feature branch locally and remotely:
  ```bash
  git branch -d feature/add-login-api
  git push origin --delete feature/add-login-api
  ```

---

### **4. Keeping the Fork Updated**

Sync your fork with the main repository to avoid conflicts:

git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```
