## üî¢ Notcoins and Equity Allocation

![Equity Distribution Infographic](assets/equity_distribution.png)

- **Total Notcoins Supply**: 20,000,000 Notcoins (fixed supply)
- **Initial Value per Notcoin**: Based on the initial valuation and updated as milestones are reached.
- **Total Mined Notcoins**: Updated weekly as tasks are completed.

### Equity Distribution Equation
Each Notcoin represents a fraction of Notfall‚Äôs total equity. Your **Ownership Percentage (P)** is calculated as:
\[
P = \frac{N_{\text{earned}}}{N_{\text{total mined}}} \times 100
\]
where:
- \( N_{\text{earned}} \) = Notcoins you‚Äôve earned,
- \( N_{\text{total mined}} \) = Total Notcoins mined across all contributors to date.

For example, if 2 million Notcoins have been mined and you‚Äôve earned 40,000:
\[
P = \frac{40,000}{2,000,000} \times 100 = 2\%
\]

### Contributor Dashboard Tracking
On the **Contributor Dashboard**, you can track your:
- **Notcoin balance**
- **Ownership percentage**
- **Latest company valuation**

Updates occur monthly, reflecting the latest company metrics.

## üéñ Advanced Valuation Scenarios

The valuation of Notfall Engineers grows based on milestones and user growth. Here‚Äôs how Notcoin value might change in different growth scenarios.

![Valuation Scenarios Infographic](assets/valuation_scenarios.png)

### Scenario 1: Early Growth Phase
- **Initial Valuation (V)**: $500,000
- **Price per Notcoin**:
  \[
  \text{Price per Notcoin} = \frac{500,000}{20,000,000} = 0.025 \text{ USD}
  \]
  With 10,000 Notcoins, your equity value would be:
  \[
  10,000 \times 0.025 = 250 \text{ USD}
  \]

### Scenario 2: Post-Milestone Growth
- **Valuation (V)**: $2,500,000 following major milestones.
- **Price per Notcoin**:
  \[
  \text{Price per Notcoin} = \frac{2,500,000}{20,000,000} = 0.125 \text{ USD}
  \]
  If you own 10,000 Notcoins, your equity value is:
  \[
  10,000 \times 0.125 = 1,250 \text{ USD}
  \]

### Scenario 3: High Growth after Major Release
- **Valuation (V)**: $10,000,000 after a significant platform release.
- **Price per Notcoin**:
  \[
  \text{Price per Notcoin} = \frac{10,000,000}{20,000,000} = 0.50 \text{ USD}
  \]
  With 10,000 Notcoins, your equity value would be:
  \[
  10,000 \times 0.50 = 5,000 \text{ USD}
  \]

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Validator Roles and Reward Structure

Validators ensure high-quality contributions and validate tasks for quality and impact.

![Validator Roles Diagram](assets/validator_roles.png)

### Validator Reward Equation
Validators receive Notcoins based on task impact:
\[
V_{\text{reward}} = 10 + (5 \times I)
\]
where:
- **I** = Impact factor (1 to 3)

For example, a high-impact task (impact factor 3) would reward:
\[
V_{\text{reward}} = 10 + (5 \times 3) = 25 \text{ Notcoins}
\]

### Validator Tasks
Validators ensure quality through:
- **Milestone Verification**: Confirming major features and growth milestones.
- **Critical Feature Testing**: Validating algorithms, compliance tools, and AI models.
- **User Experience Audits**: Ensuring a seamless, intuitive interface.
